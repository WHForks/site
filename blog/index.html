The <code>Result</code> type often doesn’t fit in CPU registers, and callers of fallible functions have to check whether the returned value is <code>Ok</code> or <code>Err</code>. That’s a stack spill, a comparison, a branch, and a lot of error handling code intertwined with the hot path that <em>just shouldn’t be here</em>, which inhibits inlining, the most important optimization of all.<p>Exceptions and panics make it easy to forget about the occasional error, but they don’t suffer from inefficiency. Throwing an exception unwinds the stack automatically, without any cooperation from the functions except the one that throws the exception and the one that catches it. Wouldn’t it be <em>neat</em> if a mechanism with the performance of <code>panic!</code> and the ergonomics of <code>Result</code> existed?<p><a href=./you-might-want-to-use-panics-for-error-handling/>Keep reading</a></div><div class=post-entry><h2><a href=ru/base64-has-a-fixed-point/>У base64 есть неподвижная точка</a></h2><time>August 3, 2024</time><pre><code class=language-shell><span class="hljs-meta prompt_">$ </span><span class=language-bash>&LT/dev/urandom <span class=hljs-built_in>base64</span> | <span class=hljs-built_in>base64</span> | <span class=hljs-built_in>base64</span> | <span class=hljs-built_in>base64</span> | <span class=hljs-built_in>base64</span> | <span class=hljs-built_in>base64</span> | <span class=hljs-built_in>base64</span> | <span class=hljs-built_in>base64</span> | <span class=hljs-built_in>base64</span> \

It keeps the constant factor small and uses long forgotten algorithms people used before processors supported SIMD and integer division. But another limitation made this task much harder.<p>Size.<p>Professional libraries start exceeding the <a href=https>Codeforces</a> limit of 64 KiB really fast. Code minification barely helps, and neither does resorting to ugly code. So I cut a corner I don’t typically cut.<p>Undefined Behavior.<p>These two words make a seasoned programmer shudder. But sidestepping UB increases code size so much the library can hardly be used on CF. So I took a gamble. I meticulously scanned every instance of UB I used intentionally and made sure the compiler had absolutely no reason to miscompile it. I wrote excessive tests and run them on CI on all architecture and OS combinations I could think of. I released the library without so much as a flaw. It worked like clockwork.<p>And then, 3 months later, I updated README, and all hell broke loose.<p><a href=./i-thought-i-was-smart-enough-to-play-with-fire/>Keep reading</a></div><div class=post-entry><h2><a href=./recovering-garbled-bitcoin-addresses/>Recovering garbled Bitcoin addresses</a></h2><time>April 23, 2024</time><p><a href=https://zeronet.io/>ZeroNet</a> is a decentralized network that enables dynamic sites, such as blogs and forums, unlike popular content-addressed storage networks that came later. Sites aren’t addressed by immutable hashes; instead, site updates are signed by Bitcoin addresses.<p>A moot point is that Bitcoin addresses are case-sensitive, and people are used to addresses being case-insensitive. Mistakes happen, and sometimes the only trail you have is a lower-cased address, like <code>1lbcfr7sahtd9cgdqo3htmtkv8lk4znx71</code>.<p>Losing valuable information is a bad thing when you’re an archivist. Have we <em>really</em> lost access to the site if we only know the lower-cased address?
